Among Us Bot
===========

A dumb little bot that allows members in a discord server with the "Among Us" role to get randomdly assigned either
'crewmate' or 'imposter' when a user types "who among us".

More features to come, maybe?

User Commands
=========
* who among us - will randomly assign 20% of players the imposter role, and the rest the crewmate role.

Setup
=====
* Python 3+
* Install https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* Create file bot_token.txt with your bot's auth token (no newline)
* `python bot.py`

And that's it! Let it run, and hopefully it won't crash
